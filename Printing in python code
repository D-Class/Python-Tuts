Python Code

# Print functions are the most basic python functions and can be used for:
# Printing strings (words and letters), calculations, and stating true or false
# Print functions can take a string argument
#  You can't open and close a print function with different quotations.
print('Hello, World!')
# Print functions can also do calculations within them:
print(2+1)
print(4 * 5)
# You can also have a print function print out blanks:
print()
# They can also state whether an argument is true or false
print(2 == 1)  # This should return 'False' with a capital
# And anything typed after a hash is ignored by the interpreter, they are used for notes and comments
# You can even type multiple data types, such a strings and integers and floats:
print('Look!', 'I can print multiple data types!', ' And in the same print function!', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
# You can even print the same strings as many times as you want:
print(5 * 'Good! ')
# Pattern
print(1 * 'A')
print(2 * 'A')
print(3 * 'A')
print(4 * 'A')
print(5 * 'A')

print('This string \n has been \n split \n along \n more lines')
print('This string \t has been \t tabbed')

print('The new kid\'s uh... sleepin\' \'n his bedroom')
